        I am a native <strong>Los Angelino.</strong> Since I was a small child I've longed to create, I knew that I wanted to be a photographer. All of the photographs I took as a child have been lost to time. I'm good at what I do and far from success. I can't give up photography even if I wanted. The photojournalist in me loves to shoot street photography, capturing life, real moments as they are happening. The      <strong>artist </strong> in me loves shooting fashion and artistic nudes, in the studio and in nature.
        Today I'm working on becoming a <strong>Front-End Web Developer.</strong>
