        Thank you for having a look at my page. This is a small mix of the photos that I've taken. I majored in photo-journalism at Los Angeles Valley College. And I've worked for celebrity photographers Jerry Avenaim, Jeff Katz, Bret Ratner and a few not so famous ones. I've shot a lots of bands playing live and have been published in news papers, magazines and books. For the moment I'm shooting street photograhpy and artistic and glamour nudes. Check out my Instagram Hippie with a Gun to see my day to day work.
